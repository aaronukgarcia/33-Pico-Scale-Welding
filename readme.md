Pico-Scale Welding: Nanoscale Material JoiningTechnical Specification: Achieving positional accuracy of ±50 nm (1σ) for the repair of Fan-Out Wafer-Level Packaging (FOWLP) redistribution layers1.📖 OverviewThis repository hosts the technical specifications, simulation parameters, and control architecture for the Pico-Scale Welding Programme.Our objective is to operationalize Electrospray Nanowelding within the "Nanoscale Thermal Regime" (1–100 nm)—a length scale where Fourier's Law breaks down due to ballistic phonon transport2. This project targets the repair of sub-5 μm defects in advanced semiconductor packaging, a market segment currently unserved by traditional wire bonding3.We operate with a "worse-before-better" J-Curve cost model, targeting a long-term production density where electrical resistivity is within 3× of bulk material values4444.⚠️ Research Status & Risk ProfileCurrent Phase: Phase 1 (Prototyping & Characterization)5.Fragility Assessment: 78% (approx. 22% success probability)6.Timeline: 20-month development cycle7.This is a high-risk, exploratory engineering effort. We openly acknowledge substantial technical hurdles, including domain shift in AI deployment and cycle time variance due to sintering physics8888.🏗️ Technical Scope1. The PhysicsWe utilize the Two-Temperature Model (TTM) to describe electron-lattice energy exchange under ultrafast heating9. The target Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ) is 500 nm, derived from the electron diffusion length under femtosecond laser heating (~140 nm conservative bound) and superconducting coherence lengths10.2. Architecture Down-SelectionFollowing feasibility analysis, Electrospray Nanowelding was selected as the primary architecture. Alternative methods (Atomic Fountain Deposition and Plasma Bridge Welding) were terminated due to fundamental physics constraints11.3. Software & ML StackWe maintain a strict Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using CycloneDX format12.ComponentVersionRolePyTorch2.1.xDefect Classification (ResNet-50) 131313ONNX Runtime1.16.xInference Engine 14OpenCV4.8.xImage Normalization (TIFF/PNG handling) 15🤝 Invitation to ContributeWe are actively seeking contributions to address specific "Capability Gaps" identified in our feasibility analysis.🧠 Challenge A: AI ExplainabilityThe system uses a ResNet-50 backbone to classify defects as Repairable, Scrap, or Uncertain16.The Problem: Operators require human-readable "features" to trust the model.Contribution Goal: Improve feature extraction to output semantic descriptions (e.g., "Linear discontinuity, 12 μm length", "Adjacent to via") rather than pixel heatmaps17.⏱️ Challenge B: Tail Latency ManagementThe Problem: Sintering times vary significantly based on material volume. We project P99 latency events (240s) occurring approximately every 100 joints18.Contribution Goal: Develop scheduler algorithms that can accommodate a 10% schedule buffer and handle "slow-sintering" events without triggering a full system abort19.🏭 Challenge C: MES Interface (SECS-II)The Problem: Integrating with legacy Fab Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES).Contribution Goal: We need to build a robust JSON-to-SECS-II translation layer to validate message exchange milestones in Month 1220.
